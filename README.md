# SharpestMinds-Application
A project for my SharpestMinds Application.

I implemented a long short term memory neural network using keras with tensorflow backend to generate chorales in the style of Bach. The structure was based on a keras example that uses a lstm network for character generation starting with a corpus of nietzche's writings. 

If you want to try it out, check out the testing_ground jupyter notebook! It allows you to load the compile the network and then enter your own initial segments of music and see what the network comes up with.
